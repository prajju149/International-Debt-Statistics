# International-Debt-Statistics
Analyzes global debt data to explore trends, key borrowers, and financial risks in developing countries.

This project aims to Analyze international debt statistics and delve into the key aspects of international debt statistics, providing insights into definitions, trends, and the significance of such analysis in the global economy.  
The world's debt situation has become more complicated in recent years. Many countries owe more money, and there are concerns about whether they can pay it back. The COVID-19 pandemic made things worse, causing governments to borrow even more money.

The data used in this project is provided by The World Bank. It contains both national and regional debt statistics for several countries across the globe as recorded from 1970 to 2015.

Think of it this way. If you borrow $20 from your buddy, who has the money? You have the money. You’re in debt to him for $20, but you have the $20. You started with $0, now you have two things, a debt for $20 and $20, which adds up to $0.
The problem here is that the only reason you wanted to borrow the money is so you could spend it today.
So you spend it on that pizza. Now the pizza guy has $20, you have $0, and a debt for $20. Now you have negative $20.
So in this scenario, the people who have the money aren’t the people who bought government bonds, they don’t have money they have an IOU from the government. The government doesn’t have the money, because they spent it on stuff like aircraft carriers and social security. So the people who have the money are the aircraft carrier manufacturers and the old folks on social security. Except they don’t have the money either, since they already spent it on things like hookers, cocaine, rent, and food.
